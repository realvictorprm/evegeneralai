  <h1>Introducing our website</h1>
  We finally started our website to collect and present our current research results, success for all interested persons.
  Currently you can find information regarding the intention of this project, how the project is named, who we are and of course our members.
  However, this was only possible through the possibilities of GitHub, Jekyll and the designer of the website template. Thanks for that!</p>

  <b>At this point I would like to give special thanks to:</b><br />
